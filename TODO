- pass %{rpmcflags} to build
- make the i486 build a i486 build, not i586 build ('zero' instead of hotspot?)
- better descriptions
- Polish descriptions for subpackages
- javaws manual on x86_64 (it is not installed for some reason)
- check and improve jre Provides (though the APIs should be java-* or java(*),
  not like in current java-sun-jre)
