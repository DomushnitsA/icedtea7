- desktop files, icons, etc. Some of these are included in the source root dir
- maybe build Shark VM, at least on i486, as the zero-assembly VM is very slow
- javaws manual on x86_64 (it is not installed for some reason)
- check and improve jre Provides (though the APIs should be java-* or java(*),
  not like in current java-sun-jre)
- pass %{rpmcflags} to build
